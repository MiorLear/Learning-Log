# Learning Log â€” 2025-08-05

## Goals for Today
- [x] Review Merge Sort algorithm
- [x] Study the basics of C++ (syntax, input/output, control flow)
- [ ] Practice solving problems using Merge Sort in C++

## What I Learned

### **Topic 1: Merge Sort**
- Merge Sort is a **divide and conquer** algorithm.
- It divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.
- Time complexity is **O(n log n)** in all cases (worst, average, best).
- Merge operation uses **extra space**, making it not in-place.

### **Topic 2: C++ Introduction**
- Basic syntax is similar to C and Java.
- I/O handled via `cin` and `cout` (in `<iostream>`).
- Use `std::` namespace or `using namespace std;`.
- C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.
