C++ — Getting Started
I’m starting to learn C++. It’s a general-purpose programming language that’s fast and powerful. It’s mostly used in systems programming, game engines, embedded systems, and stuff where performance really matters.

C++ is basically an extension of C, but it adds features like classes and object-oriented programming. It also gives you more control over things like memory, which can be cool but also dangerous if you mess it up.

What I’ve noticed so far:

You have to manage your own memory (no garbage collector like in Python or Java).

Syntax is stricter and more “manual,” but once you get used to it, it makes sense.

You can write both low-level and high-level code in the same program.
